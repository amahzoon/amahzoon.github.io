[**SCA-based Verification**](http://www.sca-verification.org/)

* This website provides formal verification solutions based on Symbolic Computer Algebra (SCA) for complex arithmetic circuits, such as multipliers.

[**GenMul**](http://www.sca-verification.org/genmul/)

* GenMul is a multiplier generator which outputs multiplier circuits in Verilog. The input size of a multiplier and each multiplier stage can be configured with GenMul.
